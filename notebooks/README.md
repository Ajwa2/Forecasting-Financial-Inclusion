# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model development, and visualization.

## Structure

- Analysis notebooks should be named descriptively (e.g., `01_data_exploration.ipynb`, `02_feature_engineering.ipynb`)
- Keep notebooks focused on specific tasks
- Document your findings and insights
